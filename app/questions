1) Explain REST and RESTful

REST is an architectural style whose have some properties :
    - Stateless
    -Use only HHTP protocol
    -
    -Resource manipulation through representations
        - Once a resource is known, can manipulate with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT & DELETE)
    -No permanent link between Client and Server
    -Return JSON or XML response


RESTful follows all the above properties.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)




3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)

GET : Use to retrieve a data

PUT : Update an existing resource

POST : Update an existing resource

DELETE : Delete a resource

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?

Stateless : State management is achieved by the client and the server do not store any context about client

Stateful : Stateful protocol keep specific details of a client

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)

GET : the parameters are sent in the URL

POST : the parameters are stored in the request body

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?*

    1- First I try to search my problem on Internet for see if any person also encountered it
    2- If I don't solve the problem, I try to search in the official documentation or I try to present this problem to my colleague
